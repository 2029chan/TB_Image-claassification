# TB_Image-claassification
This system automates tuberculosis detection through chest X-ray analysis, providing rapid and reliable preliminary screening results. The solution processes X-ray images through a Python program that extracts 96 key features, which are then analyzed using a trained machine learning model implemented on Arduino hardware.
